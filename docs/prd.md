# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Conversion Tools Bank

## Overview
Conversion Tools Bank is a suite of lightweight web-based utilities that convert various file types (e.g., EML to PDF, STL to STEP) within a centralized app. It offers a freemium model with CRM-integrated email capture, user accounts, usage tracking, and a donation-based upsell strategy.
